A complete .vim directory. This is mostly for me to keep my vim settings in sync across machines, but feel free to use it.

Usage
-----
To use just have Vim version  7 or higher and replace you ~/.vim directory with this. BE CAREFUL NOT TO BLOW AWAY YOUR .vim FOLDER UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT TO.

	git clone https://github.com/KurToMe/.vim.git ~/.vim


After that create a symbolic link to the vimrc file inside.

	ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc .vimrc
